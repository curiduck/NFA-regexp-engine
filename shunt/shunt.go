/*
The Shunting Yard algorithm is stack based.
For the conversion there are two strings the input and the output.

The stack is used to hold the operators not yet added to the output queue eg. +, -, Ã—
The algorithm then does something depending on what operator is read in eg. "3 + 4" --> "3 4 +"

For the full algorithm in detail follow https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunting-yard_algorithm#The_algorithm_in_detail
